# StringCalculator
## Description
Implement a simple String calculator with the operations add, substract and multiply.


## Exercise
Given a String we want to apply mathematical operations **from left to right**.

Use the following operators: "+" (add), "-" (substract) and "*" (multiply).

> **Examples:**

> "2+2" = 4

> "2+3+4" = 9

> "3+3*2-4" = 8

> **Note:** This is a basic exercise. Focus in TDD practice and do the tiniest step in each iteration.
